0.3.7
=====
* Showing page title and file/directory names as UTF-8 correctly.
* Escaping with htmlspecialchars() for all displays of file/directory names.

0.3.6
=====
* Adding controls bar at page bottom.
* Adding background music player to controls bar.
* Moving previous/next buttons to controls bar.
* Adding slideshow start/stop buttons and close button to controls bar.
* Introducing config.ini file (can be both global or local) for configuring the gallery view and some other settings.
* Refactored some more to improve code understandability.
* Made Google Analytics configurable through config.ini.
* Some minor cosmetic improvements.
* Fixed bugs pertaining to clearer separation between the two user interface variants.
* Wrote INSTALL file to help people setting up PHP Directory Listing on their servers.

0.3.5
=====
* If there is a file "README.txt" present, its content will be shown inside a <pre>-Tag below the directory content.
* Integrated jQuery Fancybox to show PNGs, JPGs and GIFs when they're clicked.
* Removing trailing slash from folder names as it messed up the layout sometimes (and they're not really necessary since folders have their own icon anyway).

0.3.4
=====
* Properly escaping content of HTML files.
* New variable $url in index.php which you can set to where PHP Directory Listing is installed. Then using it for a certain directory becomes as easy as simpling softlinking index.php into that directory.
* Changed empty file marker "[empty file]" into an m-dash to maintain language agnosticism.
* Fixing link size limitation for directories.
* Making filetype detection case-insensitive.
* Changed the Thumbnail class to always produce JPEGs, which seems to be more compatible with certain server setups.
* Replacing urlencode() with rawurlencode() in some places for RFC 1738 compliancy. Trying very hard to always be XHTML 1.0 Strict compliant with this, so if you still find cases where this is not true because of unforeseen filenames, please do mention!
* Fixing sorting to have directories come on top again.
* Caching PDF thumbnails like is done for all other thumbnails. Their generation is still monkey-patched into DirectoryListing.class.php, though.
* Added some filetypes to the list of text files that can be previewed.
* Showing the current folder in <title> now, thanks to some DAMN fine regular expression there which shows just how powerful the internets can be as a form of contemporary communication. Yeah, baby.
